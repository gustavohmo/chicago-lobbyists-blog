Jan 12, 2012 - Today, we received the following <a href='/docs/RFP Declination Letter Chicago Lobbyist.pdf'>letter of declination</a> from the City of Chicago regarding our <a href='/2011/12/15/our-response-to-chicagos-lobbyist-rfp/'>bid proposal to build an online lobbyist registration system</a>. In the letter, <a href='http://www.crowehorwath.com/'>Crowe Horath LLP</a> was stated as the company that the City awarded the contract to. 

The reason for our rejection is most definitely due to us not fulfilling the <a href='/docs/Spec101998.pdf'>RFP requirements</a> set out by the <a href='http://www.cityofchicago.org/city/en/depts/dps.html'>Department of Procurement Services</a>. As we stated in our blog post, a group of 5 volunteers is not what the City's RFP is set up to select.

What is surprising, however, is the firm that the city did choose. Crowe Horath is the same firm that built the <a href='http://cityofchicago.org'>City of Chicago's current website</a>. Here is some interesting background information on that:

<div class='clear'></div>

* In May 2010 the city <a href='http://newsblogs.chicagotribune.com/clout_st/2010/03/city-of-chicago-unveils-redesigned-web-site.html'>spent $1.8 million</a> on the first website redesign in 9 years
* It was built by <a href='http://www.crowehorwath.com/ContentDetails.aspx?id=1148'>Crowe Horwath</a>, an accounting & consulting firm based Oak Brook, IL
* The design was subcontracted out to <a href='http://www.delphiaconsulting.com/narrative/web%20design%20portfolio'>Delphia Consulting</a>, a design and usability based in Columbus, OH
* The same two companies also built the <a href='http://www.explorechicago.org/'>Explore Chicago website</a> and <a href='http://www.crowehorwath.com/ContentDetails.aspx?id=1321'>applied the same design</a> to City of Chicago website

At an <a href='http://www.meetup.com/OpenGovChicago/events/38655692/'>OpenGov Chicago meet up</a> in November (whom I am an event organizer for), the group reviewed and <a href='https://groups.google.com/forum/embed/?place=forum/OpenGovChicago#!topic/opengovchicago/Zr284xOnARU'>critiqued the shortcomings of the City's website and gave feedback on ways to improve it</a>. The general consensus of the group is that the City's website has many usability problems, so much in fact, that the city is looking to redesign it again after being in use for less than two years.

The question now is, with Mayor Emanuel touting innovation and change, why is it still business as usual when it comes awarding the projects that really matter?
