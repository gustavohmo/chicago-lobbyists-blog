Curiously, our award was given to us unsigned by MCIC President Virginia Carlson. <a href='http://mcic3.mcfol.org/'>MCIC</a>, or Metro Chicago Information Center, is the organization that runs Apps for Metro Chicago.

The overall winner was <a href='http://spothero.com/'>SpotHero</a>, a website that connects parking demand to parking supply by allowing parking spot owners to earn income by renting their spot when it's unoccupied. Congrats to them and all the other winners!
