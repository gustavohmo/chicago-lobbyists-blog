Aug 2, 2011 - Questions related to ChicagoLobbyists.org
1. Is there a way to determine compensation that comes to a firm versus lobbyist? (We can’t be sure adding up compensation of all lobbyists within a firm is accurate.)
2. Is there a way to determine how much a client paid to a lobbying firm or lobbyist?
3. Related to the question above, can we retrieve the purpose for a client payment?
4. Can we receive data before 2010? If so, what years are available?
5. Is there a way to determine which client requested an action in front of an agency? We only know which lobbyist requested an action—see example: http://chicagolobbyists.org/lobbyists/theodore-brunsvold
6. Are street addresses available for lobbying firms (some give political donations from many different addresses)?
7. Do you have a good state contact from which we could request political donation data?
8. Is there a list of all city datasets available (besides those on Socrata)?
9. Is there a schedule of when particular datasets are updated (frequency, time period)?
10. Is there anything related to the ethics ordinance that we might be able to help on?
